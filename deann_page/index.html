    <p>So, I recently decided to really put in a lot of effort when it comes to learning software and web programming
        stuff. I like to think that it'll be possible for me to make a career out of it if I really put in my all. So
        far so good! It's been about a week of me working hard at it, and I'm incredibly surprised with the fact that I
        haven't gotten bored or quit yet! ^^ I haven't been this proud of myself in a long time. Corona virus has been
        awful lately, but I'm happy with the time I've had to dedicate and foster an interest in something that could
        really help me in the future. </p>

    <h2 id="second-post" class="headers">Second post</h2>
    <h6 class="date"> Still 3/28/2020</h6>

    <p> I hope that I will continue on with this. My goal is to study hard enough and often enough that by 2021 I could
        potentially start looking at junior developer jobs. I want to start looking in Dublin, I think. Wish me luck!

    <p> Well it was super interesting to find this old page again. Man, I haven't looked at this in almost two years.
        It's safe to say I have learned a lot in this time and plan on updating the styling of this page soon. I was
        looking at the code for this and I'm suprrised to see I didn't even have a separate CSS style sheet. Weird!! I
        think I was studing with the Oden project when I first created this. I'm so happy to say I've gotten the ball
        rolling again with a renewed passion to finish Colt's web development bootcamp. I'm excited to keep going ^^
    </p>
